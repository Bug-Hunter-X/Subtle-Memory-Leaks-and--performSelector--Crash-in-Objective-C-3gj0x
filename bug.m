In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

The issue here is that while `self.myString` uses a strong property, causing it to retain the allocated string, there's no corresponding release when the object's lifecycle concludes. If `MyClass` is not properly released, the allocated string will never be released, leading to a memory leak.  This leak will only be noticeable with more frequent allocations and might not immediately crash the app. The developer may be incorrectly assuming ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) handles everything without explicitly managing memory.

Another lesser-known error involves using `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` without handling potential crashes. If the selector doesn't exist on the target object, an exception can occur silently and be difficult to debug, especially in complex application workflows.
