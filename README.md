This repository demonstrates two common, yet easily overlooked, errors in Objective-C programming.  The first showcases a memory leak resulting from incorrect memory management, even with ARC. The second illustrates potential crashes from `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` when the selector doesn't exist.  Understanding and addressing these issues is crucial for creating robust and stable Objective-C applications.
